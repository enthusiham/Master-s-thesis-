#Academic Innovation: Effectively Contributing to Scholarly Communities
##Motivation
###Academic innovation, that is, making a valuable academic contribution to a scholarly community is a challenging endeavour and over the past few decades several prominent management researchers have published advice on how scholars may do this (e.g., Barney, 2018; Rindova, 2008; Shepherd & Wiklund, 2020).
###A central theme within this stream of work is the importance of situating the intended contribution within an existing academic community – or more specifically, joining a particular scholarly conversation within the community (Huff, 1999).
###For example, in their editorial on writing entrepreneurship papers, Shepherd & Wiklund (2020, p. 372) write: “While anchoring a paper in a relevant entre-preneurial phenomenon is necessary, it is not sufficient to motivate an academic study. This anchoring needs to be complemented by highlighting the importance of the study vis-a-vis the entrepreneurship literature.”
###This anchoring may typically be observed in the form of relevant citations to the work on which a given new academic paper builds (Barney, 2018).
###However, much remains to be learned about how the content of a new academic paper compares to the papers it cites in practice – that is, how a new academic contribution actually relates to the existing conversation it seeks to join – as well as the implications this has for the paper’s acceptance within the scholarly community, which may be understood as the degree to which future academic contributions build upon it.
###Understanding this is important since it can give scholars insights on how to position their new academic contributions within the extant literature to add the most value for the scholarly community they seek to address.
###We therefore investigate the following two research questions:
###1) How does the content of an academic paper compare to the papers it cites? I.e., what does “standing on the shoulders of giants” really look like when it comes to academic innovation?
###2) To what extent does the similarity between a paper and its reference papers affect the acceptance/innovative value of the focal paper in the scholarly community? E.g., as measured by latent topic similarity to predict the number of citations the focal paper receives.
